A STEM Trivia Game

There are ten multiple choice questions in this trivia game.  The player has 15 seconds to answer each question.  The game keeps track of how many questions the player gets right, wrong, or unanswered. 

After each question has been answered or after the 15 seconds has expired without an answer, a new screen will appear for 5 seconds.  This screen will tell the player if their answer was correct.  If it was not correct the game will display the answer.  After 5 seconds the game displays the next question.  When all the questions have been presented the game displays the results.
